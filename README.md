A stepping stone for people interested in playing Go. Go is an ancient abstract board game created in China more than 2,500 years ago. The aim of a professional Go player is to surround more territory than their opponent. As you can imagine, the game can become quite complicated amongst professionals. Especially while playing on a standard 19x19 board. I've provided a beginner version of the game to pique your interest a bit. Hopefully you enjoy and decide to move on to more complicated levels. First person to get 5 in a row wins.
